{"name":"Vnoel.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\n\r\nI am now working in the Intro group at the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (CNRS) in Palaiseau, France. My research topics include:\r\n\r\n* Ice clouds (some of them known as cirrus) and their overall impact on the climate, either locally or globally, including UTLS clouds and PSCs.\r\n* How they relate to water vapor distribution in the UTLS and near the TTL.\r\n* Correlations between the ice crystal properties (size, shape, orientation and so on), the water content and the cloud radiative impact and lifetime.\r\n* Retrieval of these properties through remote sensing observations, esp. polarized.\r\n* Using results from these studies, provide General Circulation Models and Mesoscale simulations of climate evolution with somewhat more accurate models for cirrus clouds.\r\n\r\nI can be contacted at vincent dot noel at lmd.polytechnique.fr.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recent works\r\n\r\n* Hoareau, C., Keckhut, P., Noel, V., Chepfer, H., and Baray, J.-L., 2013: A decadal cirrus clouds climatology from ground-based and spaceborne lidars above south of France (43.9° N–5.7° E), Atmos.

Who knows.\r\n* I maintain the SEL2 dataset which contains description of optically thin clouds from remote sensing measurements.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
